# TextLens

Growing up as a child of immigrant parents, I had wish technology like this had existed so 6 year old me didn't need to translate important financial and health related documents. This is to help other families out there like mine! With a snap of a photo, the user will see a translation summary of what the document is about in their language of choice and have it read it out to them!

A full-stack app designed to assist immigrants in translating documents using Azure's APIs, ensuring accurate and efficient language translation and speech. (Optical character recognition , text to speech, language, openAI APIs)

## Tech Used:

- Javascript, React, Node.js, Express, Multer, CSS, MongoDB/ Azure's CosmoDB

- APIs: Azure's Cognitive Services for image detection, OpenAI for summarization of image text, Azure's language translation, Azure's text to speech

- Model View Controller Framework (MVC) 

### Things I'm proud of:
- Learning and using React for this project! Definitely not what I am use to but I am loving it!

### Next steps:
- Creating a sleek design
